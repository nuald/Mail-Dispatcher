<p>Mail Dispather is a tool for dispatching (basically, deleting) email messages on 
POP3 server via Plain or SSL connection with advanced filtering capabilities. 
It is distributed under GPL3 and above license. Written in Python with using PyGtk. 
</p>
<p>ATTENTION! Due to certail problems with py2exe Windows setup package is
temporarily unavailable and only source package could be used. To start program in Windows use command:
"python bin/maildispatcher" in the directory of the application after extracting it from sources.</p>
<h2>Why do I need Mail Dispatcher?</h2><br/>
Mail Dispatcher could be useful for a user:
<ul>
	<li>Who works with the same mailbox at home and in the office and stores all messages on server or</li>
	<li>Who has slow or unstable connection to the Internet (like via dial-up, GPRS modems) 
	and doesn't not want to download any unwanted messages.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
  For making the task of dispatching messages easier Mail Dispatcher provides basic filtering capabilities. 
  It supports two kinds of filters:  
<ol>
	<li><strong>Deletion filters.</strong> 
	When applying these filters Mail Dispatcher marks all applicable messages as "for deletion".
	</li>
	<li><strong>Storing filters.</strong>
	When applying these filters Mail Dispatcher hides all applicable messages 
	from the list of available not to delete them unintentionally.
	</li>
</ol>
These filters are applied automatically during refreshing the list of messages from server. 
If some messages were marked for deletion Mail Dispatcher warns a user about deleting messages from server. 
<h1>what can mail dispatcher do?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Supports Plain and SSL connections.</li>
  <li>Previews messages.</li>
  <li>Allows filtering (deletion and storing filters).</li>
  <li>Allows sorting by various criteria (from, to, size, subject).</li>
  <li>Stores settings between sessions.</li>
</ul>
<h1>mail dispatcher in prospects</h1>
<p>The main purpose of the project is increasing competitive ability of open source email clients for Linux and other OS users. 
Mail Dispatcher now is only a pilot project, and it will be used as the basis
for creating extensions to Thunderbird, Evolution and other open source email clients. 
Many users use proprietary email clients (like TheBat!) only because they have such useful 
features like dispatching mail on the server.
</p>
	<p>However, Mail Dispatcher can be useful for some users not only as an extension, but also as independent program. So we will not stop 
	it's development and we will work on Mail Dispatcher and email clients' extensions simultaneously within the project.</p>
	The short-term objectives are the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Create packages for all basic platforms (Linux, Windows, MacOSX).</li>
		<li>Add support for several accounts.</li>
		<li>Use spam filters like SpamAssasin.</li>
		<li>Add support for various secure storages (GNOME Keyring, KWallet, Apple Keychain and KeePass).</li>
	</ul>
